## Tech/Framework Used

The project is constructed on the MERN stack, leveraging a set of core technologies:

- **MongoDB:** This NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, ensuring efficient and scalable data management.
- **Express.js:** Utilized as the backend web application framework, Express.js aids in creating robust APIs and web applications, providing a seamless connection between the frontend and database.
- **React:** As a versatile JavaScript library, React facilitates the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces, enhancing the user experience.
- **Node.js:** Serving as the JavaScript runtime environment for server-side scripting, Node.js enables the development of scalable applications.

In addition to the core stack, the project incorporates several essential APIs:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure authentication and authorization, JWT plays a pivotal role in ensuring data security and user access control.
- **Socket.IO:** Enabling real-time communication, Socket.IO enhances the platform with live chat functionality, fostering immediate interaction between users and pharmacists.
- **Stripe:** Integrated for seamless and secure payment processing, Stripe ensures a smooth transaction experience for purchasing medicines.
- **Multer:** Employed for handling file uploads, Multer simplifies the process of uploading prescription files, enhancing the prescription-based medication purchase feature.
- **Joi:** Utilized for data validation, Joi aids in validating and ensuring the integrity of user inputs, contributing to a robust and secure system.
- **Nodemailer:** Integrated for email functionality, Nodemailer facilitates the sending of notifications and updates to users, enhancing communication within the platform.

These technologies and APIs collectively form the foundation of the project, enabling a comprehensive full-stack JavaScript-based development approach. Understanding and familiarity with these technologies are crucial for comprehending, contributing to, and further enhancing the project.
